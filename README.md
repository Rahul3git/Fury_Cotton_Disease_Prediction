Bales) India is the largest cotton producing country . India covers 125.84 lakh hectare area for cotton production.  But due to various disease famers faces a large loss in the production. So to help them know about the disease and to provide information about the best suitable pesticides we made  a website where we simply have to upload image of leavees and they will getall the informations.
